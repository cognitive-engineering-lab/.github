# Cognitive Engineering Lab

[As defined by Don Norman][cognitive-engineering-norman], cognitive engineering is:

> neither Cognitive Psychology, nor Cognitive Science, nor Human Factors. It is a type of applied Cognitive Science, trying to apply what is known from science to the design and construction of machines.

The Cognitive Engineering Lab is a research organization for creating human-centered software systems. Our goal is to computers to support complex cognitive tasks: programming, technical communication, learning, and so on. We use theories of human cognitive capabilities and limitations to understand how computers can best provide such cognitive support.
